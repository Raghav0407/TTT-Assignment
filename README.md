Hello Everyone,

In this project I have done the analysis of the number of words in my content file.

Firsty , I made a Display component to display the whole data.

I fetched all the contents from the provided link (https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt) using fetch command.

I  got all the data and now I have to parse the whole content such that it becomes key-value pair .

I sorted the data and using slice command I got top 20 most frequent words from the content.

Now I have to plot a histogram of the top 20 frequent words.

I have a lot of choices to plot a histogram like:

1. Recharts

2. React Charts

3. React-Chartjs-2

But I liked Recharts a lot.

I read the documentation from the Recharts website (https://recharts.org/en-US/) and just implemented it on my project.


That's all about my project.

Thankyou..
